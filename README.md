# 👋Hi I'm Aaryan 

I'm a self-driven aspiring DevOps & Cloud Engineer with a passion for building robust, automated, and secure systems — combining a solid academic foundation with hands-on experience.

My journey began with programming in Java and building real-world projects during A-Level and continued into 1st year of University. 
Now, I'm focused on completing a rigorous **18-week DevOps Challenge** to become a certified, job-ready engineer.
